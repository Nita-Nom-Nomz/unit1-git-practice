Introduction to command line:

For this unit project work with the command line. Rather than producing a project, the goal here is working with folders, files, and Git/GitHub from the command line. For each step of this project document the commands that were used to complete each step of the project in a text editor.

Canâ€™t provide the guide that was used for this unit project that was part of the requirements for the bootcamp pre-work. Please review my-steps.txt file to review the commands that were used during this project.
